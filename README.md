# Computer Vision Project: Hough Transform and RANSAC Homography

This repository contains the solutions for **Homework 1** of COMP 425/COMP 6341 (Winter 2023), focusing on implementing computer vision techniques like **Hough Transform** and **RANSAC for Homography**. The project is divided into two main parts, each involving the implementation of key algorithms for lane detection and augmented reality using image transformations.

## Project Structure

```bash
├── hough/
│   ├── hough.py         # Hough Transform implementation for lane detection
│   └── utils.py         # Helper functions for image processing
├── homography/
│   ├── homography.py    # RANSAC Homography and AR (Augmented Reality) implementation
│   ├── run.py           # Script to run homography and generate results
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

### Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-image`

Install all the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Part 1: Hough Transform for Lane Detection

The goal of this task is to detect straight lanes in an image using the Hough Transform. The steps involved are:

1. **Edge Detection**: Using the Canny edge detector to identify edges in the image.
2. **ROI Masking**: Applying a region of interest mask to isolate the lanes.
3. **Hough Space Voting**: Implementing the Hough Transform to detect lines in polar coordinates (ρ, θ).
4. **Non-Max Suppression**: After detecting the most prominent lane, the algorithm suppresses nearby cells to detect a second lane.

#### Running the code:

```bash
cd hough
python hough.py
```

This will process the image `road.jpg` and display the results, including edge detection and lane identification.

## Part 2: RANSAC Homography for Augmented Reality

In this task, you will estimate the **homography** between two images and use it to perform an augmented reality task by replacing the book cover in one image with another book cover.

1. **Feature Matching**: Using SIFT features to detect and match points between images.
2. **RANSAC Algorithm**: Implementing RANSAC to compute the best homography matrix that aligns two images.
3. **Warping and Compositing**: Warping one image using the homography matrix and compositing it over the second image.

#### Running the code:

```bash
cd homography
python run.py
```

This will compute the homography and display the augmented reality result.

## Results

Both parts of the project will generate visual results showcasing the lane detection and augmented reality tasks. You can find example outputs in the `report.pdf` file.

## How to Submit

1. **Generate Report**: Ensure all plots and figures generated by the code are added to your report.
2. **Zip Files**: Package the code in a directory named after your full name. Zip the folder and submit it to the course portal along with your report.

```bash
zip -r lastname_firstname.zip lastname_firstname/
```
